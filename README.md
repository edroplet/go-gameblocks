# go-gameblocks

Game engine toolkit for Go.

Some good stuff in here, but fairly specific to my own projects at the moment.  
It may generalize more over time.

Some things that already work well:

- Cameras (Quat and Euler based, with lerping)
- Shader managing (with reloading support)
- Scene managing (basic for now, need to flesh it out into a tree-based thing)
- Control key binding


## Goals

- Multiple rendering backends
  - [x] Support golang.com/x/mobile backend
  - [ ] Support additional backends (glfw)
